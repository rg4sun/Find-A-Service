Before starting the project, please install the project dependencies:

```shell
yarn
# or use npm
npm install
```

The default git branch should be in `main` , if the main branch cannot start the webpage normally, please switch to `release/beta1` branch:

```shell
git checkout release/beta1
```

If you still encounter any problems after switching branches, it may be that the API Key of Firebase or Mapbox has expired, please replace it with a new API Key.
